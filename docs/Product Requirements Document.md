# Product Requirements Document: Digital Rock Climbing Logbook

## 1. Executive Summary

The Digital Rock Climbing Logbook is a specialized application designed to fill the gap between existing route discovery platforms and comprehensive training applications. While climbers currently have access to social climbing apps and route-finding tools, they lack a dedicated solution for logging sessions, tracking progression, and analyzing performance over time. This product addresses that need with a mobile-first logging experience enhanced by AI voice input, complemented by a web platform for detailed analytics and goal tracking.

## 2. Product Overview

### 2.1 Product Vision
To create the definitive digital logbook for rock climbers that seamlessly captures climbing data through innovative voice logging, provides meaningful insights into performance progression, and helps climbers achieve their goals through data-driven training recommendations.

### 2.2 Product Positioning
Unlike Mountain Project or Kaya (route discovery focus) or general fitness trackers, our logbook specifically addresses the unique needs of climbers who want to:
- Quickly log climbs during or after sessions
- Track detailed performance metrics specific to climbing
- Understand their strengths and weaknesses across different climbing styles
- Set and achieve climbing-specific goals with data-backed insights

### 2.3 Key Differentiators
- AI-powered voice logging for hands-free session recording
- Climbing-specific analytics (grade progression, style analysis, endurance tracking)
- Seamless mobile-to-web experience optimized for different use contexts
- Focus on personal progression rather than social features or route beta
